# Introduction to Python

## Overview
This two week course is will cover the basics of Python,
focusing on its use in astronomy research. Most of this course
is designed around "learning by doing", and is not meant to be
a substitute to a more formal programming course. This is driven
by the fact that there's not enough time two weeks of short classes
to learn enough Python for any particular research project. Since
you will almost certainly be learning a lot of Python "on the job",
the goal of this course is to try and teach you how to teach
*yourself* Python given a reasonable foundation to build on.

## Material
We will cover Python programming basics, packages, how to use them,
how to search for help, basic debugging, and 
reading/interpreting code. We're not going to systematically 
hit all these points with basic exercises, but instead to cover 
them more or less organically while starting to do some real science.
This should provide motivation for introducing new concepts 
while also situating them in useful contexts (which hopefully 
is more fun!).

Note that this course is designed to be challenging, and you
are highly encouraged to spend as much (or little) time on the
exercises as you feel is appropriate both inside and outside of
class.

## Requirements
The material used here assumes very basic knowledge of coding but 
does not require any previous coding experience. Most of the exercises
will be provided in Jupyter Notebooks, which will form the 
backbone of this course. It does not require major outside
dependencies.

## Format
The course is be divided into four parts, each
lasting approximately two days:

- In part 1, we will focus on learning enough of the basics
to get by. This will cover syntax, variables, loops, data 
structures, and so forth.

- In part 2, we will simulate photometric and spectroscopic
observations of a galaxy. This will focus on array/list
manipulation, loops, and utilities and introduce the `numpy`
and `matplotlib` packages.

- In part 3, we will derive a period-luminosity relationship
for Cepheid variable stars. This will focus on simulation and
(black box) function use/interpretation as well as basic
statistics. It will also introduce the `scipy` package.

- In part 4, we will measure cosmological parameters from
Type Ia Supernovae. This will introduce additional data
analysis tools and statistical methods while synthesizing
the material covered throughout the course.
