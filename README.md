# python-week-2

The goal of this week is to become comfortable hacking at code.
This includes learning basic packages, how to use them, and how to
search for help, basic debugging, and reading/interpreting code.
The course will also begin to introduce some of the more advanced
functionality available in Python, especially concerning array
operations/manipulations.

The idea in this course is not to systematically hit all these points
with basic exercises, but instead to cover them more or less organically
while starting to do some real science. This provides motivation for
introducing new concepts while also situating them in useful contexts.

The main project is to simulate a photometric and spectroscopic
observations of a galaxy. The associated exercises for each
portion are self-contained in respective iPython Notebooks.
